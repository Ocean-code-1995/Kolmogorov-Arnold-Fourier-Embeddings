## New Embedding Approach
---

#### Current: KAN-Fourier(Flatten(image))

#### New: Linear(Flatten(Conv2D(image)))

### **Should You First Use Conv2D for Patches?**
It depends on what you want to achieve:

---

### **1. Direct FourierKAN on Flattened Pixels (Your Approach)**
- **Pros:**  
  - The network directly sees raw pixel values and can learn global frequency patterns from the start.  
  - No inductive bias from convolutions—KAN is free to learn arbitrary mappings.  
  - May capture low-frequency/global structures better.

- **Cons:**  
  - Might struggle with very high-resolution images, as FourierKAN’s parameter count and complexity grow with input dimension.  
  - Missing the local-receptive-field bias of Conv2D, which is helpful in early vision stages.

---

### **2. Conv2D Patches + FourierKAN (Hybrid Approach)**  
- **Workflow:**  
  - Use a Conv2D (with stride = patch size) to break the image into local patches (like ViT).
  - Flatten each patch and feed them into a FourierKAN layer for embedding.

- **Pros:**  
  - Conv2D introduces locality, focusing on small patches first (similar to wavelets or local filters).  
  - FourierKAN then processes structured patch tokens, which may be more stable and data-efficient.
  - Reduces the dimension of the input to FourierKAN (from `H x W x C` pixels to `num_patches x patch_dim`).

- **Cons:**  
  - Adds a bias toward local information (which might not always be desirable).
  - Slightly more complex pipeline.

---

### **My Recommendation:**
- If your dataset is small or your resolution is high, **starting with Conv2D patches + FourierKAN** might give more stable training.
- If you’re doing experiments on **small images (e.g., CIFAR-10)**, **direct FourierKAN on flattened pixels** could be very interesting and worth testing first.

### **Would You Like Me to Give You Two Code Templates?**
1. **Direct FourierKAN embedding (your current idea)**  
2. **Conv2D patch extraction + FourierKAN**  

So you can compare them side-by-side?
