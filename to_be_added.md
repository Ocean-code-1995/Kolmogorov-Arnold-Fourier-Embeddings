**Summary of Suggestions for Improving the Paper**

### **1. Quantitative Measures for Evaluating Attention Focus**
Instead of relying solely on visual inspection, consider adding a quantitative evaluation of attention maps:

- **Intersection over Union (IoU)**: Compare the overlap between model attention and expert-annotated coral regions.
- **Entropy-Based Attention Spread**: Use Shannon entropy to measure whether attention is focused or dispersed.
- **Attention Mass on Coral Regions**: Compute the proportion of total attention weight focused on corals vs. background.
- **Correlation with Classification Confidence**: Analyze whether stronger attention on coral regions correlates with higher classification confidence.

### **2. Statistical Significance Testing: Bootstrap Hypothesis Testing**
To validate performance differences between embedding methods, use bootstrap hypothesis testing:

1. Define the null hypothesis (e.g., no significant difference between Fourier-KAN and Convolutional embeddings).
2. Resample test set predictions with replacement to generate multiple bootstrap samples.
3. Compute the performance metric (e.g., accuracy difference) for each sample.
4. Construct a **95% confidence interval** from the bootstrapped differences.
5. If the interval **excludes zero**, the performance difference is statistically significant.

**Example Implementation in Python:**
```python
import numpy as np

# Simulated accuracy differences
accuracy_diffs = np.random.rand(100) - np.random.rand(100)

# Bootstrap resampling
bootstrap_diffs = np.random.choice(accuracy_diffs, size=(10000, 100), replace=True).mean(axis=1)

# Compute confidence interval
lower, upper = np.percentile(bootstrap_diffs, [2.5, 97.5])
print(f"95% Confidence Interval: [{lower}, {upper}]")
```

### **3. Confidence Interval Analysis for Performance Metrics**
Instead of reporting single performance scores, use confidence intervals (CIs) to quantify uncertainty.

- **Bootstrapping Approach:**
  1. Resample the dataset multiple times (e.g., 10,000 iterations).
  2. Compute the metric (e.g., accuracy) for each resampled set.
  3. Compute the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles to get a **95% CI**.

**Example Implementation in Python:**
```python
accuracy_scores = np.random.rand(100)
bootstrap_samples = np.random.choice(accuracy_scores, size=(10000, 100), replace=True).mean(axis=1)
lower, upper = np.percentile(bootstrap_samples, [2.5, 97.5])
print(f"95% Confidence Interval for Accuracy: [{lower:.3f}, {upper:.3f}]")
```

- If **confidence intervals for different models do not overlap**, the performance difference is likely significant.

### **Final Recommendations**
- **For attention evaluation:** Use IoU (if coral regions are annotated) or entropy-based measures.
- **For statistical significance testing:** Use **bootstrap hypothesis testing** instead of parametric tests like paired t-tests.
- **For uncertainty quantification:** Use **confidence intervals via bootstrapping** instead of reporting single performance values.

These refinements will strengthen the **scientific rigor** of the paper and improve its **publication readiness**.
